# DeepLearningFinalProject
Project work created as a part of Deep Learning course at New York University.

This repository contains the colab code and the report for our study of applying Deep Learning Techniques to Automatic Story Generation (AGS). 

Story generation is an intriguing field within natural language processing (NLP) that involves the automatic generation of coherent and engaging narratives. It has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains, such as interactive storytelling, virtual assistants, and content generation.
We explore the use case of story generation using the WritingPrompts dataset, released by Facebook Research. The dataset consists of over 300,000 writing prompts, each designed to inspire storytelling. It includes corresponding human-authored stories that serve as examples or responses to the prompts. Our objective is to train and evaluate story generation models using a part of this dataset, aiming to generate coherent and imaginative narratives that closely align with human-authored stories.
